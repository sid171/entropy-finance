# Fintropy

This project follows the DRIVER methodology for finance/quant tool development.

## What Is This?

An intelligent financial analysis chat app that applies entropy-based frameworks to market analysis:
- **Textual Entropy** — Regime shift detection from news/text
- **Transfer Entropy** — Directional information flow (who leads, who follows)
- **Sample Space Expansion** — When the investment universe itself changes
- **Entropy Collapse** — Irreversibility markers in structural breaks
- **Belief System Entropy** — When cultural/market assumptions break

## DRIVER Workflow

1. `/driver:define` — Establish vision, research what exists (开题调研)
2. `/driver:represent-roadmap` — Break into 3-5 buildable sections
3. `/driver:implement-screen` — Build and run, iterate on feedback
4. `/driver:validate` — Capture evidence it works
5. `/driver:evolve` — Generate final export package
6. `/driver:reflect` — Capture lessons learned

## Philosophy

**Cognition Mate (认知伙伴):** 互帮互助，因缘合和，互相成就

## Next Step

Run `/driver:define` to begin.
